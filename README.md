### Hi there 👋

#### From Brazil living in Madrid 🇧🇷 > 🇪🇸

I like to code and automate boring stuff.

- 🧰 Tooling: `neovim`, `zellij`, `lf`
- 💻 Work: QA / SDET since 2010: `python`, `js`, `linux`, `iptv - ott`, `network`
- 🏠 Hobbies: `tune my setup`, `aoc`, `DS&A (improving)`, `personal projects`, `YouTube`
